# PHP Framework (pet-project)
*Probably very irresponsible to use in production*

This is a simple customized MVC framework based upon a course i did a few years ago. Later on I've written some extra functionality for it.
This framework includes:
- basic router
- custom route wildcard support
- custom basic templating
- custom route middleware support
- custom basic JWT authentication 
- front-end workflow automation using Gulp
